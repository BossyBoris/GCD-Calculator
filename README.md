# GCD Calculator
This project calculate the greatest common denominator of two numbers using Eculid's algorithm. This is also one of my earilest Python projects which let me experience the python environment.

## Usage
If you would only like to calculate the GCD quickly, run:
```
python3 gcd_calulator.py
```
If you want you calculation result to be saved to a file and be viewed later, run and follow the on-screen instruction:
```
python3 gcd_calculator_history.py
```
